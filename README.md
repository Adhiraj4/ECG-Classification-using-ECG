# ECG-Classification-using-ECG
This is a Machine Learning Classification application of ECG signals, using Scikit and python
The Python notebook is given, I have used multiple undersampling and oversampling strategies, because the dataset is really imbalanced. 
The datset has already been split. 

I have implemented an MLP Neural Network and a stacking classifier with Random Forest and Decision Trees as the base classifiers with Random Forest being the meta classifier.
